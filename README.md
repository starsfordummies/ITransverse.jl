# ITransverse.jl

This package provide several routines for the transverse contraction of 2D tensor networks,
it was mainly developed for the characterization of temporal matrix product states 
in the time evolution of one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. 

It is built on top of the excellent ITensors library, and tries to reuse most of its features whenever possible.




# Conventions

We start with ITensors conventions, so for an MPS we'd have something like (physical legs here point upwards, ie.
we think of applying an MPO to an MPS like a tetris brick falling from the top - in order words, if we think of time 
evolution operators, time would go upwards)


```
      p
      |
 L----o----R
```

and for an MPO 

```
      p'
      |
 L----o----R
      |
      p
```

The application of an MPO to an MPS is simply their product (ITensors automatically contract equal indices) and then noprime the remaining physical index.

The 2D network associated with the time evolution of a quantum chain is 

```

^          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|          o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o
|          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| t        o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o  U(dt)
|          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|          o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o  U(dt)
|          |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|---->     o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o  |psi0>
   x
```



## Rotated / Transverse MPS-MPO

In order to make contact with the usual wiring in our brains that works with horizontal chains,
after defining our tMPS it may be useful to think of "rotating" the network by 90 degrees, redefining the 
old virtual indices of the MPO as new _temporal physical_ indices. In the same way, we can relabel the physical 
(spatial) indices as _temporal virtual_ indices.

More specifically, our current conventions (mostly for historical reasons and possibly subject to change, though that would likely result in massive code breaking) is the following:

We rotate our space vectors to the left by 90°, ie 

```
    |p'               |R                 |p'new
    |                 |                  |
L---o---R   ==>   p'---o---p   =  Lnew---o---Rnew
    |                 |                  |
    |p                |L                 |pnew
```

so the index renaming convention is 

``` 
(old)   (new)
 L    ->  p
 R    ->  p'
 p    ->  R
 p'   ->  L
```


For building the tMPO, we contract with the operator `fold_op` on the *left*
and the initial state `init_state` on the *right*, ie. 

```
              p'
         |    |    |    |
[op] X==(W)==(W)==(W)==(W)==o [in]
         |    |    |    |
              p
```
